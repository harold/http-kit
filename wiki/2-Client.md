# Client

```clojure
(:require [org.httpkit.client :as http])
```

Like the Server, the client uses a lightweight and efficient event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

 - Easy-to-use API, modeled after [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http)
 - Timeout per request
 - Concurrency made easy by promises
 - HTTPS supported: ~100k of RAM for issuing a HTTPS request - TCP connection and SSLEngine get reused if possible
 - Keep-alive makes quite a difference in performance, and can be disabled with {:keepalive -1}

# Basics

## Asynchronous with promise

```clojure
;; Returns immediately (modulo DNS lookup time), returned promise is captured
(def resp-promise (http/get "http://host.com/path"))
```

## Asynchronous with callback

```clojure
(http/get "http://host.com/path"
	  {:timeout 200 ;; ms
           :basic-auth ["user" "pass"]
           :query-params {:param "value" :param2 ["value1" "value2"]}
           :user-agent "User-Agent-string"
           :headers {"X-Header" "Value"}}
          (fn [{:keys [status headers body error]}] ;; asynchronous response handling
            (if error
              (println "Failed, exception is " error)
              (println "Async HTTP GET: " status))))
```

## Synchronous w/ `@`

```clojure
(let [{:keys [status headers body error] :as resp} @(http/get "http://host.com/path")]
  (if error
    (println "Failed, exception: " error)
    (println "HTTP GET success: " status)))
```

The returned promise is simply `deref`'d immediately.

## Combined, concurrent requests, handle results synchronously

Sends both requests without waiting...

```clojure
(let [resp1 (http/get "http://http-kit.org/")
      resp2 (http/get "http://clojure.org/")]
  (println "Response 1's status: " (:status @resp1)) ;; blocks here for resp1
  (println "Response 2's status: " (:status @resp2)))
```

## Persistent connection

HTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair

HTTPS persistent connection is also supported.

By default, http-kit keeps idle connections for 120s. That can be configured by the `:keepalive` option:

```clojure
; keepalive for 30s
@(http/get "http://http-kit.org" {:keepalive 30000})

; will reuse the previous TCP connection
@(http/get "http://http-kit.org" {:keepalive 30000})

; disable keepalive for this request
@(http/get "http://http-kit.org" {:keepalive -1})
```

## Opts map, to pass state to callbacks

Sometimes, it's handy to pass some state to callback. You can do it this way:

```clojure
(defn callback [{:keys [status headers body error opts]}]
  ;; opts contains :url :method :header + user defined key(s)
  (let [{:keys [method start-time url]} opts]
    (println method url "status" status "in"
             (- (System/currentTimeMillis) start-time) "ms")))

;; save state for callback, useful for async request
(let [opts {:start-time (System/currentTimeMillis)}]
  (http/get "http://http-kit.org" opts callback))
```

## Output coercion

```clojure
;; Get the body as a byte stream
(http/get "http://site.com/favicon.ico" {:as :stream}
        (fn [{:keys [status headers body error opts]}]
          ;; body is a java.io.InputStream
          ))

;; Or as a byte-array
(http/get "http://site.com/favicon.ico" {:as :byte-array}
          (fn [{:keys [status headers body error opts]}]
            ;; body is a byte[]
            ))

;; Or a string
(http/get "http://site.com/string.txt" {:as :text}
          (fn [{:keys [status headers body error opts]}]
            ;; body is a java.lang.String
            ))

;; Try to automatically coerce the output based on the content-type header, currently supports :text :stream, (with automatic charset detection)
(http/get "http://site.com/string.txt" {:as :auto})
```

## Nested params

`http-kit` supports nested params, inspired by `clj-http`:

```clojure
{:query-params {:a {:b {:c 5} :e {:f 6}}}} => "a[e][f]=6&a[b][c]=5"
```

Both accomplish this by encoding the nested data structure, expecting server understand the encoding, and do the proper decoding. This is not robust. Recommended usage is do the encoding and decoding explicitly, using your favorite encoding.

JSON is a popular choice:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.json :as json])

(http/post "http://your-server/api"
           ;; using json to encode the nested params
           {:query-params {:a (json/write-str {:b {:c 5} :e {:f 6}})}})

;; on the server side, get the param, decode it using json/read-str.
;; JSON supports more types and is easier to understand and reason about.
;; It's also compatible with other languages, with relatively simple server implementation
```

## Various options

```clojure
(http/request {:url "http://http-kit.org/"
               :method :get ;; :post :put :head, etc...
               :user-agent "User-Agent string"
               :oauth-token "your-token"
               :headers {"X-header" "value"
                         "X-Api-Version" "2"}
               :query-params {"q" "foo, bar"} ;; "Nested" query parameters are also supported
               :form-params {"q" "foo, bar"} ;; just like query-params, except sent in the body
               :body (json/encode {"key" "value"}) ;; use this for content-type json
               :basic-auth ["user" "pass"]
               :keepalive 3000 ;; Keep the TCP connection for 3000ms
               :timeout 1000 ;; connection timeout and reading timeout 1000ms
               :filter (http/max-body-filter (* 1024 100)) ;; reject if body is more than 100k
               :insecure? true ;; Need to contact a server with an untrusted SSL cert?
               ;; File upload. :content can be a java.io.File, java.io.InputStream, String
               ;; It will read all content before sending to server:
               ;; should be used when the file is small, say, a few megabytes
               :multipart [{:name "comment" :content "httpkit's project.clj"}
                           {:name "file" :content (clojure.java.io/file "project.clj") :filename "project.clj"}]
               :max-redirects 10 ; Max redirects to follow
               ;; whether follow 301/302 redirects automatically, default to true
               ;; :trace-redirects will contain the chain of the redirects followed.
               :follow-redirects false})
```

`http/get` `http/post` etc, are all built on top of `http/request`, so, these options apply to them too

# Advanced topics

## Mocking requests in tests

Often in tests you want to prevent requests from being sent over HTTP by stubbing out calls to the client. This can be done with [http-kit-fake](https://github.com/d11wtq/http-kit-fake).

```clojure
(with-fake-http ["http://http-kit.org/" "a fake response"]
  (http/get {:url "http://http-kit.org/"})) ; promise wrapping the faked response
```

## Server Name Indication (SNI)

http-kit 2.4+ supports client SNI on Java 8+.

Support is **automatically enabled** for http-kit 2.7+.
Or support can be manually enabled by using the bundled SNI client:

```clojure
  (:require [org.httpkit.sni-client :as sni-client])

  ;; Change default client for your whole application:
  (alter-var-root #'org.httpkit.client/*default-client* (fn [_] sni-client/default-client))

  ;; or temporarily change default client for a particular thread context:
  (binding [org.httpkit.client/*default-client* sni-client/default-client]
    <...>)
```

See [`org.httpkit.client/*default-client*`](http://http-kit.github.io/http-kit/org.httpkit.client.html#var-*default-client*) for more details.

If you're seeing `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure` errors, there's a good chance that your client doesn't have SNI support enabled.

## Unix Domain Sockets (UDS)

http-kit 2.7+ supports server+client UDS on Java 16+.
To use, plug in appropriate `java.net.SocketAddress` and `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel` constructor fns:

```clojure
(require '[org.httpkit.client :as hk-client])

(let [my-uds-path "/tmp/test.sock"
      my-client
      (hk-client/make-client
        {:address-finder  (fn [_uri]     (UnixDomainSocketAddress/of my-uds-path))
         :channel-factory (fn [_address] (SocketChannel/open StandardProtocolFamily/UNIX))})]

  (hk-client/get "http://foobar" {:client my-client}))
```

See [`make-client`](http://http-kit.github.io/http-kit/org.httpkit.client.html#var-make-client) for more info.
